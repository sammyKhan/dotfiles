# My dotfiles are...

## Portable
The idea is to be able to install them on "any" workstation I use. That means newish Linux or OS X.

## Understandable
I only include things I actually understand and use. That means as few copy-pasted or complicated settings as possible.

## Vim-y
Vim style key-bindings are used wherever possible.

## To Install
```
cd && git clone https://github.com/sammyKhan/dotfiles
bash dotfiles/install.bash
```

## To Do
  * give option to download extras (ie. zsh, vim plugins etc.)
  * allow configuration of variables (eg. git user-name)
