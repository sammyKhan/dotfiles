# My dotfiles

Piecing together my development environment :)

The install script backs up the corresponding files on the system and replaces them with symlinks to the files in this repo.

## To do
  * give option to download extras (ie. zsh, vim plugins etc.)
  * allow configuration of variables (eg. git user-name)
