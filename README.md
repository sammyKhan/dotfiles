# My dotfiles are...

## Portable
The idea is to be able to install them on "any" workstation I use. That means newish Linux or OS X.

## Understandable
I only include things I actually understand and use. That means as few copy-pasted or complicated settings as possible.

## To Install
```
cd && git clone https://github.com/sammyKhan/dotfiles
bash dotfiles/install.bash
```
This backs up existing dotfiles and symlinks to the ones in this repo.

## To Do
  * make syntastic optional
  * give option to restore from backup
  * allow configuration of variables from install script (eg. git user-name)
